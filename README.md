Hacker news for teachers

### Share the knowledge
Teachers want to be up-to-date with the best teaching trends, advice, and materials. But, time is scarce. Educator.Today lets teachers share valuable links with other teachers.

### Crowd Moderation
Posts are sorted algorithmically. Likes give posts a boost in the rankings, but time negatively impacts rankings. This allows the most currently relevant material to be pushed to the top

### Bots
I am building bots that will periodically look for new posts on popular education or news sites and post the content.
I also am building bots that will randomly like other posts to help kick-start early users.

### Email notifications
I plan to build out automated emails when you beat your record high of likes, when you register, etc.

### Technologies
Currently full-stack Ruby on Rails with JQuery powered front-end
Planning to eventually create a new front end powered by React
